        <p>
          We're making our best to protect your info. However, we can not promise anything. There are some really smart people (and some jerks too) wanting to break things on the internet and they can eventually come to this service. We store your username and encrypted password.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, we love to mantain this project and do the best for our service and our users.
        </p>
        <h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>

We don't log your IP in our databases, however, some information about your browser and/or IP may remain in the server logs.
