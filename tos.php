        <p>
          We're making our best to protect your info. However, we can not promise you anything. There are some really smart people (and some jerks too) wanting to break things on the internet and they can eventually come to this service. We store your username and your encrypted password. However, keep in mind this information, your facts and sources saved, goes on plaintext over the internet, we have no SSL certificate, and we don't plan to have one (unless you <a href="http://www.k-lab.tk/" target="_blank">donate some money</a> to buy it).
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, we love to mantain this project and do the best for our service and our users.
        </p>
        <h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          We don't log any personal information. You decide if you give us your real name as the username used in this database. We're not interested in tracking you or communicating with you (but you can contact us whenever you want) so we don't request your email, we don't log your IP in our databases, however maybe some information about your browser or IP may remain in the server logs to which we have no access.
        </p>
        <p>
          We value your privacy as much as you do, maybe even more.
