# TheFactBook

By using TheFactBook Extension you can easily save bits of text wherever you
are reading keeping its source for later reference. Just install our addon to
your browser, set your username and password or create a new user directly from
it. When reading an article select the text you want to save, do right click and
select "Add on TheFactBook" from the menu.

Optionally, you can edit what you have selected and add some tags on it.

By clicking on "My facts" on the Extension's panel you will be redirected to
our website where you can see, read and search for keywords and tags on all
the Facts you saved!

That way you will never forget where you read it! a timestamp is also added
so if for some reason the source of the content is gone/changed you can use
[The WayBack Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to prove your point.
